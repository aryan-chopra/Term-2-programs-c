# How to execute the progeams
Make sure you have gcc compiler installed on your device and the path has been configured.
1. In the terminal window, make sure you are in the directory where your files are.
2. Execute 'gcc filename.c', replace 'filename' by the name of your file.
3. Executing the executable 'a.exe' runs the code, execute it by running './a.exe' and your program will run :)
